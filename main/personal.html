            <h2>My Guiding Principle: Una ang Ginoo</h2>
            <p>
                The principle of <span class="highlight">"Una ang Ginoo" (God First)</span> serves as the foundation for my decisions, especially in the digital world. It calls for an intentional commitment to faith-based integrity and kindness over personal gain or fleeting trends.

            <h3>Reflection on Digital Citizenship</h3>
            <p>
                As a digital citizen, my goal is to be a Light of the World online. This means every post, every interaction, and every creation must reflect honesty, respect, and compassion. It's about building others up, not tearing them down.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                "Let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven." - (Matthew 5:16, adapted for reflection)

            <h2>Integrity in Creation</h2>
            <p>
                In web development and content creation, ethical responsibility is important. This includes respecting intellectual property, citing sources properly, and ensuring all created content is truthful and morally uplifting. My commitment is to use technology not just for utility, but for spiritual significance.
